Regarding Donations
--------------------------
Donations are completly optional and you are under no obligation to donate but here I thought I would outline what donations will go torwards

As this is an open source project I have no plans to close it off and sell the software anytime in the near future. That being said I am one developer(FlamingGenius) depending on the nice people of github to contribute to the project.

As far as donations go I would like to user all money generated by tghis project to go torwards improving it weather it be new equipment(laptops),maintainers(hired workers,github contributors),frameworks(syncfusion,telerik).

I started developing this project as a way people could have the power of excel for free with the added conviniece of multi-window view. I hope that you enjoy the project and consider a donation :)
